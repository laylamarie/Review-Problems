//First, declare variable named firstName.
var firstName; 
//Assign firstName to a string value of your first name.

//Declare another variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name.

//Then declare another variable named fullName and assign it to the current value of firstName and lastName and have the joined values separated with a space character.

//Numbers
//Declare a variable named luckyNumber.

//Declare a variable named myBool and assign it the value of true.

/* 
1. Create a function factorial that when given a 
number, returns the factorial of it. The factorial
 of a number is the product of an integer and the 
 integers below it.


What are factorials? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial

For example:
factorial(1); // => 1     (1)
factorial(2); // => 2     (2 * 1)
factorial(3); // => 6     (3 * 2 * 1)
factorial(4); // => 24    (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
factorial(8); // => 40320 (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)

//Input: number
//Output: number

2. Create a function reverseString that takes in a string
 and returns the reversed version.

Example: 
reverseString('Hello, World!'); // => '!dlroW ,olleH'

*/

/*
3. Create a function that takes an input array and 
add all numbers in the array.

Example: 
var myArray = [1,2,3,4,5]

arraySum(myArray) => 15
